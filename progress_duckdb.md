# DuckDB Implementation in TTServe - Conversation Log

## User
can you access the current repo?

## Assistant
I'll check the current repository structure to understand what we're working with. Let me explore the repository to get a better understanding of it.

[After exploring the repository]

Yes, I can access the current repository. I can see this is the Safecast/TTServe repository located at `/home/rob/Documents/Safecast/TTServe`.

The repository appears to be a Go-based server application with various components. I can see:

- Go source files (`.go` files) that make up the main application
- Configuration files like `go.mod` and `go.sum` for dependency management
- Documentation files including `README.md`, `AUTHORS`, and `CONTRIBUTORS`
- Shell scripts like `run.sh` and `run-this.sh` likely for running the application

Would you like me to explore any specific part of the repository in more detail? I can look at the README, examine the code structure, or help with any specific tasks related to this codebase.

## User
can you tell me in which dadtabases the data is stored?

## Assistant
Let me investigate which databases are used in this codebase. I'll first check the README and then look for database-related code in the repository.

[After investigating the codebase]

Based on my investigation of the codebase, I can tell you that the Safecast TTServe application stores data in three main databases:

1. **Flat File Database**:
   - Used for storing device logs and status information as JSON files
   - Located in directories specified by constants like `TTDeviceLogPath` ("/device-log"), `TTDeviceStatusPath` ("/device-status"), and `TTDeviceStampPath` ("/device-stamp")
   - This appears to be a simple file-based storage system where data is organized in JSON format

2. **API Database**:
   - Used specifically for radiation measurements for Safecast
   - Data is uploaded to the Safecast API at endpoints like "api.safecast.cc" (production) and "dev.safecast.cc" (development)
   - Uses the URL pattern: `https://%s/measurements.json?%s`
   - For Solarcast data specifically, it uses: `https://api.safecast.cc/measurements.json?api_key=z3sHhgousVDDrCVXhzMT`

3. **Ingest Database**:
   - Used for storing all incoming data (comprehensive storage)
   - Data is uploaded to endpoints like: `http://ingest.safecast.cc/v1/measurements`
   - Stores data in the `ttdata.SafecastData` format

The system follows a data flow where incoming data from various sources (HTTP, UDP, MQTT, Notehub) is received, processed with metadata (device info, location, sensor status), and then routed to these three databases according to the type of data.

The configuration for these databases and their endpoints is primarily defined in the configuration files, particularly in `config.go` and related files.

## User
can you replace API  and  Ingest databases with two  new DuckDB databases  in the same formats that the data is stored in API and Ingest databases?

## Assistant
I'll help you replace the API and Ingest databases with DuckDB databases. This will involve several steps, including adding DuckDB support to the codebase, creating the database schemas, and modifying the data flow to store data in DuckDB instead of sending it to the external API and Ingest endpoints.

First, I'll add the DuckDB dependency to the project:

```bash
go get github.com/marcboeker/go-duckdb

go: upgraded gopkg.in/yaml.v3 v3.0.0-20200313102051-9f266ea9e77c => v3.0.1
```

Next, I'll examine the ttdata package structure to understand how to implement the DuckDB schemas:

```bash
find /home/rob/go/pkg/mod/github.com/\!safecast/safecast-go@v0.0.0-20210602192847-dcf96c859f9b -name "*.go" | xargs grep -l "type SafecastData"
```

Output:
```
/home/rob/go/pkg/mod/github.com/!safecast/safecast-go@v0.0.0-20210602192847-dcf96c859f9b/sc-defs.go
```

Then I created several new files and modified existing ones to implement the DuckDB databases:

[After implementing the changes]

I've successfully implemented the replacement of the API and Ingest databases with local DuckDB databases. Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. **Added DuckDB Support**:
   - Added the `github.com/marcboeker/go-duckdb` dependency
   - Created a new `duckdb.go` file with database initialization, connection management, and data storage functions

2. **Database Implementation**:
   - Created two DuckDB databases:
     - **API Database**: Stores radiation measurements (SafecastDataV1)
     - **Ingest Database**: Stores all incoming data (ttdata.SafecastData)
   - Implemented schema definitions that match the original data formats

3. **Modified Data Flow**:
   - Updated the `Upload` function to store data in the DuckDB Ingest database
   - Modified the `doSolarcastV1Upload` function to store data in the DuckDB API database
   - Added a configuration option `UseExternalEndpoints` to optionally continue sending data to external endpoints

4. **Integration**:
   - Added database initialization to the main function
   - Added proper cleanup with `defer CloseDuckDB()`
   - Updated the README to document the database changes

The implementation maintains the same data formats as the original system but stores the data locally in DuckDB databases instead of sending it to external endpoints. This provides several advantages:

- Local data storage and querying capabilities
- Reduced dependency on external services
- Maintained compatibility with the existing data formats and processing logic

You can now run the server with the updated code, and it will store all data locally in the DuckDB databases while maintaining the option to send data to the original external endpoints if needed (by setting `UseExternalEndpoints` to true in the configuration).

## User
Can you save this chat in sepeate file called propress_duckdb.md?

## Assistant
I've created a file named `progress_duckdb.md` in your TTServe project directory that documents our conversation about implementing DuckDB databases to replace the external API and Ingest databases.

The file contains:
- A summary of the initial analysis of the database structure
- Detailed implementation steps we took
- List of modified and new files
- Benefits of the DuckDB implementation
- Suggested next steps for the project

You can find the file at:
`/home/rob/Documents/Safecast/TTServe/progress_duckdb.md`

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with regarding the DuckDB implementation or any other aspects of the TTServe project?
